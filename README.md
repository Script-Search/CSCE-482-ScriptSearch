With the exponential growth of online video platforms like YouTube, the accessibility and consumption of video content have surged dramatically.
YouTube has an average of over 500 hours of video content uploaded every minute (YouTube Statistics 2024).
Amidst this vast ocean of video data, the challenge of efficiently retrieving specific information within video content has become increasingly pressing.

Traditional methods of video search heavily rely on metadata and manually generated annotations.
However, these approaches often fall short in accurately capturing the nuances and details present in video content.
Keyword-based search, for instance, may overlook relevant information due to the limitations of metadata and the inability to account for context within the video.

This highlights the importance of accurately searching transcripts, as transcripts provide a textual representation of the spoken content within videos.
Unlike metadata, transcripts offer a more comprehensive and detailed overview of the video's content, including dialogue, narration, and other spoken elements.
By leveraging transcript data, it becomes possible to enhance the search experience by enabling users to locate specific information with greater accuracy and efficiency.

In light of these challenges and the growing demand for efficient video content retrieval and analysis, there is a compelling need for innovative tools and systems that leverage transcript data to offer a more accurate and comprehensive search experience for users.
